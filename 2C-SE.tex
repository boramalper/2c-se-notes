  Lock-Modify-Unlock Model \emph{{[}OLD{]}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Advantages

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Very simple.
    \item
      Central source of truth.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Disadvantages

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Multiple developers cannot work on the same file.
    \item
      Deadlocks might occur (especially if scripts are doing some
      maintenance work on the repo for instance, say linting multiple
      files).
    \item
      Requires access to repo at all times (\emph{e.g.} you cannot
      checkout a file to modify it during the holiday, lest it will be
      inaccessible for a week).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Copy-Modify-Merge \emph{{[}NEW{]}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Advantages

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Multiple developers can work on the same file at the same time.
    \item
      Deadlocks cannot occur since there is no locking.
    \item
      Distributed repositories might be beneficial for certain
      development. models (\emph{i.e.} open-source projects where every
      contributor might want to have a full-access).
    \item
      Does not require access to repo at all times.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Disadvantages

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      More complicated than Lock-Modify-Unlock model.
    \item
      Multiple sources of truth (though in reality there is often a
      master repo).
    \item
      Merge conflicts happen, and they are not uncommon.
    \item
      Automatic merging used to be faulty sometimes but software are
      getting better.
    \item
      Not every file-type is \emph{mergable}, such as photographs, PDF
      documents, audio files, or spreadsheets.

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist

\subsubsection{Refactoring}\label{refactoring}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{As code evolves its quality naturally decays.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Because \textbf{changes are often local, without full understanding
    of the context.}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Refactoring}, is about restoring good design in a
  \emph{disciplined way}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    There are \textbf{refactoring patterns}.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      There are patterns for everything in Software Engineering...
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Refactoring is changing \textbf{internal} structure of software
  to make it:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{easier to understand, and}
  \item
    \emph{cheaper to modify}
  \end{itemize}

  \emph{\textbf{without changing its observable behaviour.}}
\item
  Refactoring was once seen as a kind of maintenance, but it can also be
  an integral part of the development process!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Agile methodologies (\emph{e.g.} XP) advocate continual refactoring.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{A refactoring is a \emph{small} transformation.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Do NOT confuse it with \textbf{rewrite}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  To ensure that refactoring hasn't \textbf{changed}/broken something?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{test, refactor, test}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{bad-code-smells}{%

\item
  Long methods
\item
  Large classes
\item
  Long parameter lists
\item
  Lazy classes \emph{i.e.} Classes that are ridiculously small.
\item

\hypertarget{verification-validation-and-testing-vvt}{%
\subsubsection{Verification, Validation, and Testing
(VV\&T)}\label{verification-validation-and-testing-vvt}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{VV\&T} generally refers to all techniques for improving
  \textbf{product quality}.
\item
  \textbf{Verification:} are we building the software \emph{right}?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Does software meet requirements?
  \item
    \emph{Static analysis, reviews, inspections, walk-throughs}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Validation:} are we building the \emph{right software}?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Does software accommodate customers' needs?
  \item
    \emph{Prototyping, early releases}
  \item
    Validation is more general than verification.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Testing is a useful technique for both.}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{testing}{%
\subsubsection{Testing}\label{testing}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In essence, testing is

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Generating stimulus} for a component
  \item
    \emph{Collecting outputs} from the component
  \item
    \emph{Checking} if \emph{actual} outputs are as \emph{expected}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Automation of tests is essential.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Speeds up the whole testing process.
  \item
    \textbf{Makes tests deterministic.}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Not necessarily always, but definitely more deterministic than a
      human being.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{assert} statements are common to compare the actual results
  and expectations.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Checks can also be spread throughout the program code
    itself.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{kinds-of-tests}{%
\paragraph{Kinds of Tests}\label{kinds-of-tests}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Testing approaches:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Black-Box Testing} purely specification-based (treating the
    component as a "black box")
  \item
    \textbf{White-Box Testing} also considers the internal structure
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Kinds of tests:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Module (or Unit) Tests} for each class in OO software
  \item
    \textbf{Integration Tests} test components interact properly
  \item
    \textbf{System Tests} check if functional and non-functional
    requirements met, \emph{verification}
  \item
    \textbf{Acceptance Tests} in customer environment, \emph{validation}
  \item
    \textbf{Stress Tests} look for graceful degradation, not catastrophe
  \item
    \textbf{Performance Tests} performance is often a non-functional
    requirements (\emph{e.g.} in real-time systems)
  \item
    \textbf{Regression Tests} more like a testing methodology, repeated
    full-tests after each modification
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-to-test}{%
\paragraph{How to Test}\label{how-to-test}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tests should be

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{repeatable}
  \item
    \textbf{documented} both the tests and the results
  \item
    \textbf{precise}
  \item
    \textbf{done on configuration-controlled software}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Ideally test spec should be written at the same time as the
  requirements spec.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Tests and requirement features can be cross-referenced!
  \item
    Use cases can suggest tests.
  \item
    \textbf{Also helps to ensure \emph{testability} of requirements.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{preconditions-postconditions-invariants}{%
\subsubsection{Preconditions, Postconditions,
Invariants}\label{preconditions-postconditions-invariants}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Method Precondition} A condition that must be true when a
  method is invoked.
\item
  \textbf{Method Postcondition} A condition that the method guarantees
  to be true when it finishes.
\item
  \textbf{Class Invariant} A condition that should \emph{always} be true
  for all the instances of a given class.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Always} as in all \emph{client-visible} states, that is,
    whenever the object is not executing one of its methods!
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{java-modelling-language-jml}{%
\paragraph{Java Modelling Language
(JML)}\label{java-modelling-language-jml}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  JML provides

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A richer language (predicate logic) for writing boolean conditions
    than Java boolean expressions (propositional logic), for example
    allowing \emph{quantifiers} such as \texttt{\textbackslash{}forall}
    and \texttt{\textbackslash{}exists}.
  \item
    Special comment syntax for common assertion types:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \textbf{Preconditions:}
      \texttt{//@\ requires\ x\ \textgreater{}\ 0;}
    \item
      \textbf{Postconditions:}
      \texttt{//@\ ensures\ \textbackslash{}result\ \%\ 2\ ==\ 0;}
    \item
      \textbf{Invariants:}
      \texttt{//@invariant\ name.length\ \textless{}=\ 8;\ }
    \item
      \textbf{General assertions:} \texttt{//@\ assert\ i\ +\ j\ =\ 12;}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Examples:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{//@ requires x >= 0.0}
\CommentTok{/*@ ensures JMLDouble}
\CommentTok{  @         .approximatelyEqualTo}
\CommentTok{  @        (x, \textbackslash{}result * \textbackslash{}result, eps);}
\CommentTok{  @*/}
\KeywordTok{public} \DataTypeTok{static} \DataTypeTok{double} \FunctionTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{double}\NormalTok{ x) \{}
    \CommentTok{/*...*/}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
  \item
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{/*@ requires a != null}
\CommentTok{  @       && (\textbackslash{}forall int i;}
\CommentTok{  @               0 < i && i < a.length;}
\CommentTok{  @               a[i-1] <= a[i]);}
\CommentTok{  @*/}
\DataTypeTok{int} \FunctionTok{binarySearch}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{[] a, }\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ x) \{}
    \CommentTok{// ...}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \begin{quote}
      Note that this universally quantified expression in JML must have
      parentheses around it, \texttt{(\textbackslash{}forall\ ...\ )}.
      \end{quote}
    \item
      \begin{quote}
      The range is optional, but if omitted, such a universally
      quantified expression may not be executable; it can still be used
      for documentation purposes, however.
      \end{quote}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  In return for the benefit of faster understanding, modular reasoning
  imposes a cost. This cost is that clients are not allowed to conclude
  anything that is not justified by the contracts of the methods that
  they call. Another way of looking at this is that, to allow modular
  reasoning with contract specifications, \textbf{the client code must
  work for every implementation that satisfies the contract.}
  \end{quote}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \begin{quote}
    Otherwise, the implementation would no longer be free to change the
    algorithm used.
    \end{quote}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  There are other good reasons not to use code as contracts.
  \textbf{Code makes a poor contract, because by only using code one
  cannot convey to readers what is intended (i.e., what the
  \emph{essential properties} of the method are) and what parts are
  merely implementation decisions (\emph{accidental features}).}
  \end{quote}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \begin{quote}
    For example, if the code for \texttt{sqrt} computes square roots to
    7 decimal places, cannot this be changed in the next release?
    Without some separate description of what is intended, the reader
    can't tell if that 7 decimal places were intended, or just happened
    to be computed; perhaps 4 decimal places are all that is necessary
    for the rest of the program.
    \end{quote}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Some tools such as \emph{jmlc, jmlrac, etc.} compile and run
  JML-annotated Java code into bytecode with specific \textbf{runtime
  assertion checking}.
\item
  \textbf{Assertions can also be used on \emph{inputs} to
  \emph{constrain} the \emph{random generation of input data}.}

  \textbf{Writing tests first often clarifies requirements!}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Testing code demands more precision than an English specification.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Idea} is

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    write tests \textbf{before} writing the code they apply to,
  \item
    run tests as code is written.
  \item
    \emph{In an ideal world, the system will be complete when all your
    tests pass. :)}
  \item
    \textbf{TFD avoids poor ambiguity resolution.}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Instead of choosing what is easiest to implement in the face of
      ambiguity, you will implement the right thing (that your tests
      check for).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Consequently}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    bugs found at earliest possible point of development
  \item
    locating bugs are relatively easy (due to locality of tests)
  \item
    \textbf{TFD ensures adequate time for test writing.}

\item

    When contrasted with testing, testing is called \emph{dynamic
    testing}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Type-checking} during compilation is a basic kind of static
  analysis.
\item
  \textbf{Trade-offs}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    As the properties checked get more complicated,

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      only smaller programs can be analysed.
    \item
      the process is less automated (\emph{e.g.} \textbf{annotations}
      required).
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    As tools are more automated and designed to work on larger programs,
    they often \emph{cannot}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist

      guarantee every problem flagged is a real error (\emph{i.e.}
      false-positives)
    \item
      find every error (\emph{i.e.} false-negatives).
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    The latter kind of tools are more to aid bug-hunting than ensuring
    \emph{correctness}.

\item
  \textbf{Activities:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Software Specification} goals, functionality, and
    constraints
  \item
    \textbf{Software Development} producing software: design,

  \item

  \item
    \textbf{Software Evolution} adapting software to changing needs and

\hypertarget{waterfall-model}{%

\includegraphics{2C-SE.assets/1543142448637.png}

\textbf{Pros:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Better than no process at all, makes clear that requirements must be
  analysed, software must be tested, \emph{etc.}
\item
  Suitable for

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    very slowly evolving systems where high-reliability, safety
    \emph{etc.} are top priorities (\emph{e.g.} engine control unit of a
    car), in other words, \textbf{safety-critical}
  \item
    for \textbf{embedded systems} where resources are extremely limited
    and deployment is often only once (during flashing!),
  \item
    very \textbf{large systems} where the interaction between multiple
    components must be clearly laid out (which also allows simultaneous
    development of different components).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cons:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Inflexible and unrealistic: \emph{e.g.} verification will show up
  problems with requirements capture.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Many real-world application (need to) evolve rapidly in response to
    the changing customer needs and competitive market conditions.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Slow and expensive: in an attempt to avoid problems later, we end up
  "gold plating" early phases.

  \begin{itemize}

\textbf{Cons:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

      As opposed to demanding them read 100 pages long manual.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Provide \emph{meaningful} (\emph{i.e.} actionable) error messages.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \emph{E.g.} Bad: "File Save Error" Good: "File could not be saved
      because disk is full; open up some space and try again."
    \item
      This is not always easy of course, there are tons of assumptions
      we make within our abstractions which -\/-when violated-\/- does
      not yield a meaningful error message.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{User diversity}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Remember that users vary on numerous levels on various axes.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Healthy, colour-blind, blind
    \item
      Healthy, hearing-impaired, deaf
    \item
      Fluent in English, intermediate, doesn't know English, or even
      illiterate!
    \item
      Power users, casual users
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Wherever possible, provide choices for \emph{customisability}.
  \item
    Often there are legal obligations about \emph{accessibility}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{task-analysis}{%
\paragraph{Task Analysis}\label{task-analysis}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What tasks users want to do with the system?
\item
  In what order and combination?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{E.g.} Information should be presented wherever it is required.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    AND to reduce the clutter, \emph{information should not be
    represented wherever it is not required.}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Running through user stories and use cases are often useful here.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{user-interaction}{%
\paragraph{User Interaction}\label{user-interaction}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  How do users interact with the system?
\item
  \textbf{Direct manipulation} such as drag-and-drop
\item
  \textbf{Menu selection} perhaps on a directly selected object
\item
  \textbf{Form fill-in} typically used for data entry
\item
  \textbf{Command language} typically used by traditional systems (UNIX)
\item
  \textbf{Natural language} sometimes as a front end to a command
  language, but more advanced versions have emerged such as Siri, using
  NLP
\item
  \textbf{Body language} such as Nintendo Wii, or XBox Kinect
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{information-presentation}{%
\paragraph{Information Presentation}\label{information-presentation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  How should information be presented to the user?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This has \emph{nothing} to do with the way information is
    represented internally.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Continuously varying information is best represented in an analogue
  representation (\emph{i.e.} continuous graphs), not as numbers.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Data visualisation}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Presentation should depend on the audience: \emph{e.g.} graphs
  vs graphics.}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{colour}{%
\paragraph{Colour}\label{colour}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use few colours \emph{consistently}, no more than four or five per
  context and no more than seven in total.
\item
  Colour changes should signal something significant.
\item
  Be careful about colour pairings (\emph{e.g.} do not put red on blue
  background).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Contrast also affects accessibility; low contrast is harder to
    process visually (in general, but especially for the visually
    impaired).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In general, vary colours along only one of the three dimensions (hue,
  saturation, brightness) to make a distinction.
\item
  Know the output technology; primary green is often unreadable on
  screen but fine in print.
\item
  Remember that around 10\% of men are red-green colour-blind!
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{interface-design-and-evaluation}{%
\paragraph{Interface design and
evaluation}\label{interface-design-and-evaluation}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Design iteratively.
\item
  Only real end users are good judges of the interface; testing is
  important.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Evaluation is hard; get professionals, read HCI books.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In expensive or critical software, involve professional from
  appropriate fields (\emph{e.g.} ethnography).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{intellectual-property-ip}{%
\subsubsection{Intellectual Property
(IP)}\label{intellectual-property-ip}}

\begin{quote}
IP is not property, and it's not intellectual. It resists definition,
but one definition of IP might be: \emph{a monopoly right to exploit an
intangible product of human thought or labour.}
\end{quote}

Several broad categories:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{copyright} applies to literary or artistic works
\item
  \textbf{patents} apply to inventions of things or processes
\item
  \textbf{design rights} apply to design of products
\item
  \emph{none of these were invented with software in mind...}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{patents}{%
\paragraph{Patents}\label{patents}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Arose to protect \emph{inventors} of physical objects or processes.
\item
  \textbf{Stronger than copyright}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    stops other people using/making object even if they invented it
    independently
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Duration is sorter} -\/- 17 years
\item
  \textbf{Software patents are controversial}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In U.S., yes; in Europe, no (roughly speaking).
  \item
    In U.S., \emph{business processes} are patentable (\emph{e.g.}
    Amazon has patents on \emph{one-click} shopping, and on the idea of
    customers reviewing products!).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{copyright}{%
\paragraph{Copyright}\label{copyright}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copyright protects \emph{the expression of an idea}, not the idea
  itself.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{The original IP.}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Restricts the ability to copy, adapt, \emph{etc.} artistic or literary
  works.
\item
  \textbf{Unlike patents, no merit {[}invention{]} is required; this
  document is a literary work for copyright purposes.}
\item
  \textbf{Duration is longer} -\/- life of author + \textasciitilde{}70
  years.
\item
  \textbf{The protected rights may be \emph{assigned} in whole or in
  part, or \emph{licensed} in whole or in part, with or without
  restrictions.}
\item
  Source code is subject to copyright.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Object code and machine code are \emph{adaptations or translations}
    of source code, hence protected.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Clean-room reverse engineering is permissible under many
  jurisdictions.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{licenses}{%
\paragraph{Licenses}\label{licenses}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Can be licensed per computer, per user, or per CPU cores!
\item
  Sometimes it's the license to access and use a website.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{E.g.} Office 365
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Shareware/Fremimum, Free Open Source, Proprietary, ...
\item
  GPL -\/- General Public License

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{copyleft} -\/- modifications or adaptations of the work
    (including other works which depends on it) must be licensed under
    the same license.
  \item
    As a result, \emph{copyleft licenses are incompatible with each
    other}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  LGPL -\/- Lesser General Public License

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{weak copyleft} -\/- same as GPL, except other works which
    depends on our work does \emph{not} have to be licensed under the
    same license.
  \item
    Again, incompatible with other copyleft licenses.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Choosing a license may depend on:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{philosophy} some consider restricting software to be
  unethical, some motivated by utilitarian views...
\item
  \textbf{legal constraints} you may have used other software that
  restricts your choices (proprietary or copyleft).
\item
  \textbf{business relevance} sharing the most valuable asset of your
  company might not be the best business strategy!
\item
  \textbf{support} do you want your users to contribute?
\end{itemize}
